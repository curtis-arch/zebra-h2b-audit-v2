Whether you are working in fields such as finance, healthcare, or [marketing](https://www.aampe.com/blog/three-ways-aampe-helps-you-activate-your-marketing-data) , mastering data normalization techniques in Excel will enable you to prepare data for better decision-making processes. Excel offers multiple methods to normalize data, such as z-score, min-max scaling, and decimal scaling, among others. These methods adjust the data according to the nature of your dataset and the goal of your analysis. Knowing when and how to apply these methods will make your data more consistent and easier to interpret. Using built-in functions and formulas, you can effectively standardize a dataset, even if you do not have a statistical background.\\nUnderstanding how to normalize data also involves grasping the concept behind each method. It is essential to choose the appropriate technique for your specific needs, as the choice can impact the outcome of your data analysis. This familiarity with different normalization techniques can significantly enhance the clarity and efficiency of your work in Excel. ## **Understanding Data Normalization**\\n\\nData normalization is a process vital to data analysis, ensuring that datasets are comparable and bias-free. ### **What Is Data Normalization? **\\n\\nData normalization involves adjusting values measured on different scales to a common scale, which enables you to perform meaningful comparisons. For instance, if you wish to compare the exam scores of two classes where one test was scored out of 100, and the other was scored out of 50, you normalize the scores to a common scale before comparing.\\n### **Benefits of Data Normalization**\\n\\n* **Consistency** : Normalization ensures that the same data standards are applied across different datasets, making your analysis more reliable. * **Error Reduction** : By employing a systematic approach to data scaling, you minimize the likelihood of errors that can arise from dealing with data on different scales. * **Improved Analysis Quality** : With normalized data, statistical analyses, such as regression or clustering, yield more accurate results as they are not skewed by the scale of the input data. ## **Preparing Your Excel Workbook**\\n\\nBefore normalizing data in Excel, ensure your workbook is properly set up, and data is consistent to facilitate accurate calculations. ### **Setting Up Your Data**\\n\\nTo start, you'll need to lay out your data in a tabular format. Organize your dataset with:\\n\\n* Rows representing records. * Columns representing variables. For example:\\n\\nID      Variable 1      Variable 2      ...\\nVariable n              1      x11      x12      ...      x1n              2      x21      x22      ...      x2n\\n\\nEach column should have a clear **header** that identifies the variable. Avoid empty rows or columns within the dataset, as they can interfere with data processing. ### **Ensuring Data Consistency**\\n\\nTo maintain consistency within your workbook:\\n\\n1. Check and correct data types:\\n\\n\\n* Use **Number** format for numerical data. * Apply **Date** format for dates. * **Text** format should be used for non-numeric data. 1. Verify that there are no discrepancies in your data, such as:\\n\\n\\n* Inconsistent use of units (e.g., mixing kilometers and miles). * Variations in spelling or naming conventions (e.g., \\\"Usa\\\" vs \\\"USA\\\"). Review the dataset thoroughly for missing values or outliers that might skew normalization, and handle them according to the analytical requirements and methodologies of your project.\\n## **Basic Normalization Techniques**\\n\\nData normalization in Excel helps to adjust values measured on different scales to a common scale, enabling better comparison and integration of data. ### **Using Simple Formulas**\\n\\nTo normalize data, start with the simplest approach by dividing each value by the maximum value in your dataset. For instance, if the maximum value is 100 and your value is 75, the normalized value is 0.75. The formula in Excel would be =A2/MAX($A$2:$A$100), assuming your values start at A2 and end at A100. ### **Applying Scale Normalization**\\n\\nScale normalization involves altering the range of your data. Normalizing between 1 and 10, for example, involves applying the formula =1+((value-min)/(max-min))\\\\*9. If **A2** is your value, **MIN($A$2:$A$100)** for the minimum and **MAX($A$2:$A$100)** for the maximum, the formula in Excel would be =1+((A2-MIN($A$2:$A$100))/(MAX($A$2:$A$100)-MIN($A$2:$A$100)))\\\\*9.\\n### **Implementing Min-Max Normalization**\\n\\nMin-Max normalization adjusts your values so that they fit within a specific range, typically 0 to 1. Use the formula (value-min)/(max-min). Replace value with the cell reference, for example A2, min with MIN($A$2:$A$100), and max with MAX($A$2:$A$100). The formula in Excel is =(A2-MIN($A$2:$A$100))/(MAX($A$2:$A$100)-MIN($A$2:$A$100)). ## **Advanced Normalization Methods**\\n\\nIn this section, you'll learn about two sophisticated techniques for data normalization in Excel: Z-Score Standardization and Decimal Scaling Normalization. These methods can enhance the accuracy of your data analysis. ### **Z-Score Standardization**\\n\\nZ-Score Standardization transforms your data into a distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Use this method when you want your data to reflect how many standard deviations away each value is from the mean. Here are the steps to perform Z-Score Standardization:\\n\\n1.\\n ... \\nAn Excel formula reflecting decimal scaling could look like this:\\n\\n**Example** : With a MaxAbsValue of 12345 (5 digits), data point 123 would be scaled as:\\n\\nYour data values will now be between -1 and 1, which standardizes the variance across your dataset. ## **Troubleshooting Common Issues**\\n\\nWhen normalizing data in Excel, you might encounter various issues that can affect the accuracy and efficiency of your analysis. This section provides solutions to common problems you may face during the normalization process. ### **Handling Errors in Formulas**\\n\\nIf you see **\\\\/0! ** , **\\\\? ** , or other error values, there's likely an issue with your formula. Double-check for these potential mistakes:\\n\\n* Syntax errors: Ensure you've used the correct syntax for functions and that all parentheses are properly paired. * Reference errors: Verify that cell references are correct. An incorrect cell reference can cause errors or return inaccurate results.\\n### **Dealing with Inconsistent Data**\\n\\nInconsistency in data formats can lead to problems in normalization calculations. Address this by doing the following:\\n\\n* **Text to Columns** : Use the _Text to Columns_ feature to split combined data into separate columns. * **TRIM and CLEAN** : Use _TRIM_ to remove extra spaces and _CLEAN_ to remove non-printable characters. ### **Addressing Outliers**\\n\\nOutliers can skew your normalized data. Identify and address them appropriately:\\n\\n* Detection: Use conditional formatting to highlight outliers for easy identification. * Decision: Decide whether to remove, adjust, or keep outliers based on the context and goal of your analysis. ## **Utilizing Excel Tools and Features**\\n\\nMicrosoft Excel offers a variety of tools and features specifically designed to aid in the normalization of data, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in your analysis.\\n### **Leveraging Pivot Tables for Normalization**\\n\\n**Pivot Tables** are powerful Excel features that allow you to summarize data efficiently. To normalize data using pivot tables:\\n\\n1. Select your dataset. 2. Go to the Insert tab and select PivotTable. 3. In the PivotTable create dialog, choose the data to be included and the desired location for the pivot table report. 4. Drag and drop relevant fields to Rows, Columns, Values, and Filters to organize data. This restructured data can now be easily normalized by calculating standardized scores or percentages. ### **Employing Conditional Formatting**\\n\\n**Conditional Formatting** provides a quick way to visualize and normalize data based on specific criteria. For example, you could use it to highlight cells within a standard deviation range:\\n\\n* Select the cells that contain your data. * Go to Home > Conditional Formatting. * Choose Highlight Cells Rules > More Rules. * Create a new rule based on a formula to determine which cells to format.\\n* Input a formula to calculate your normalization criteria (e.g., =(YourCell-MEAN(Range))/STDEV.P(Range)). * Set your desired format and click OK to apply the conditional formatting. ### **Exploring Excel Add-ins**\\n\\nMicrosoft Excel supports **Add-ins** , including those that assist with data normalization tasks. To explore and use add-ins:\\n\\n* Click on the Insert tab. * Select Get Add-ins to search for available tools. * Look for add-ins like DataPrep or Data Normalizer, which provide capabilities for transforming your data to a normal distribution or scale. * Install the add-in and follow its instructions for normalizing your dataset. Using these Excel tools and features, you can effectively standardize and streamline your data for more accurate analysis and insights. ## **Consolidating Normalized Data**\\n\\nAfter normalizing your data in Excel, the next step is to consolidate it, ensuring that all datasets are aligned and that data integrity is maintained throughout the process.\\n### **Combining Multiple Datasets**\\n\\nTo combine multiple datasets after normalization, ensure that each dataset has the same structure, with consistent rows, columns, and data formats. Follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Open the Excel workbook** containing the first dataset. 2. **Navigate to the 'Data' tab** and select 'Consolidate'. 3. Choose the function you want to use for consolidating (e.g., Sum, Average). 4. **Click 'Add'** to select the range from the first dataset. 5. **Repeat** the process for each dataset you’re adding. 6. **Check 'Create links to source data'** if you wish to maintain links to the original data. 7. Press **OK** to combine the datasets. Ensure your sources are accurately referenced in each range selection to avoid data misalignment. ### **Maintaining Data Integrity**\\n\\nOnce datasets are combined, data integrity becomes crucial.\\nFollow these protocols:\\n\\n* **Verify Data Consistency:** Double-check that numerical data formats, dates, and categorical data are uniform across the consolidated dataset. * **Apply Data Validation Rules:** Use Excel's data validation feature to restrict data input to certain types or values which helps in maintaining consistency for any future data entries. * **Use Conditional Formatting:** Highlight any outliers or errors that may indicate compromised data integrity. Frequent audits of the consolidated data should be performed to identify and correct any anomalies as soon as they occur. ## **Final Review and Validation**\\n\\nAfter normalizing your data in Excel, it's crucial to review and validate your dataset to ensure accuracy and to maintain the integrity of your data's layout. ### **Checking for Accuracy**\\n\\n* **Assess the Range:** Ensure that the data falls within the expected normalized range (usually 0 to 1 or -1 to 1).\\n* **Revisit Formulas:** Check all applied formulas for errors by cross-verifying with manual calculations for a few samples. * **Look for Outliers:** Identify any abnormal values that may indicate incorrect normalization. ### **Ensuring Proper Data Layout**\\n\\n* **Consistent Formatting** : Verify that numerical data maintains consistent decimal places and that text data adheres to the proper case (upper or lower). * **Alignment Check** :\\n\\n\\n* Align numbers to the right. * Align text to the left. **Table Integrity** : Confirm that the table structure is intact with no misaligned rows or columns.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/115uwza/best_way_to_normalize_data_from_a_wide_excel_file/\",\n      \"title\": \"Best way to normalize data from a wide excel file : r/Database\",\n      \"publish_date\": \"2023-02-19\",\n      \"excerpts\": [\n        \"[Skip to main content]() Best way to normalize data from a wide excel file : r/Database Open menu Open navigation [](/) Go to Reddit Home\\n\\nr/Database A chip A close button\\n\\n[Log In](https://www.reddit.com/login/) Log in to Reddit\\n\\nExpand user menu Open settings menu\\n\\n[Go to Database](/r/Database/) [r/Database](/r/Database/) •\\n\\n[TvIsSoma](/user/TvIsSoma/)\\n\\n# Best way to normalize data from a wide excel file\\n\\nWe are a small business. I currently have several workflows set up where I read data from Excel files and throw them all in a table on Microsoft SQL sever. One of these tables involves production data, with a date, work order number, room number, product name, amount produced, lead name, shift number, clean time, run time, and then an hour by hour breakdown of efficiency, amount produced, run time, along with comments from operators, along with a few other columns.

Say I have all of it set up so that there are tables that are normalized in a star schema, what next to get the excel files actually compatible with this format on a regular basis?

For example, if you have to scan over the whole table and check a text field vs checking an integer field, it could be very different amounts of memory. SQL Server has columnar indexes that might be relevant to your interests here.\\n_One thing I would do before designing anything is gather up all of your existing queries and note their average performance and frequency_ .

I would start by importing/ reverse engineering the current database tables and incrementally identify related data within the current tables and make them new tables. As far as primary keys, you can assign an artificial pk (just add a sequence number) or use an existing column/field or a combination of existing columns to be your new pks in the new tables. Then you'll need to use some SQL insert commands with select commands to populate your new tables.\\n1\\n\\n# Related Answers Section\\n\\nRelated Answers\\n\\n[Tips for normalizing data in Excel](/answers/f07f31ff-994a-4bf1-9401-2042ab7be076/?q=Tips%20for%20normalizing%20data%20in%20Excel&source=PDP)\\n\\n[Most underrated database technologies in 2023](/answers/c0586b30-afb4-42a9-8ea8-9dc6fa9ffdbe/?q=Most%20underrated%20database%20technologies%20in%202023&source=PDP)\\n\\n[Best practices for database normalization](/answers/49df926f-0236-4739-a07e-31cfd10d9abe/?q=Best%20practices%20for%20database%20normalization&source=PDP)\\n\\n[Emerging trends in data storage solutions](/answers/063ea3fa-4adf-4a5d-a3b4-225a31c10e21/?q=Emerging%20trends%20in%20data%20storage%20solutions&source=PDP)\\n\\n[Top open-source databases to consider](/answers/6d96892b-0fea-4dff-b103-dd684be33f87/?q=Top%20open-source%20databases%20to%20consider&source=PDP)\\n\\nNew to Reddit?

The existing data is loosely structured across two sheets in a work-book. The first sheet contains main record. The second sheet allows additional data. My target DBMS is mysql, but I'm open to suggestions. 1. Define RDBMS schema\\n2. Define, say, web-services to interface with the database so the same can be used for both, UI and migration. 3. Define a migration script to\\n   \\n    + Read each group of affiliated rows from the spreadsheet\\n    + Apply validation/constraints\\n    + Write to RDBMS using the web-service\\n4.

Spreadsheets are notoriously un-normalized and so have lots of duplication. You say in your other question that \\\"Data is loosely structured, and there are no explicit constraints.\\\"\\nIf you want to transform _that_ into a rigourously-defined schema (at least 3NF) then you are going to have to do some cleansing. SQL is the best tool for data manipulation. I suggest you build two staging tables, one for each worksheet. Define the columns as loosely as possible (big strings basically) so that it is easy to load the spreadsheets' data. Once you have the data loaded into the staging tables you can run queries to assess the data quality:\\n\\n* how many duplicate primary keys? * how many different data formats? * what are the look-up codes? * do all the rows in the second worksheet have parent records in the first? * how consistent are code formats, data types, etc? * and so on. These investigations will give you a good basis for writing the SQL with which you can populate your actual schema. Or it might be that the data is so hopeless that you decide to stick with just the two tables.\\nI think that is an unlikely outcome (most applications have some underlying structure, we just have to dig deep enough). **Data Loading**\\n\\nYour best bet is to export the spreadsheets to CSV format. Excel has a wizard to do this. Use it (rather than doing `Save As...` ). If the spreadsheets contain any free text at all the chances are you will have sentences which contain commas, so make sure you choose a really safe separator, such as `^^~`\\n\\nMost RDBMS tools have a facility to import data from CSV files. Postgresql and Mysql are the obvious options for an NGO (I presume cost is a consideration) but both SQL Server and Oracle come in free (if restricted) Express editions. SQL Server obviously has the best integration with Excel. Oracle has a nifty feature called external tables which allow us to define a table where the data is held in a CSV file, removing the need for staging tables. One other thing to consider is Google App Engine.\\n ... \\nAlternatively, if the data and validation rules aren't too complex, you can probably get good results with using a visual data transfer tool like [Kettle](http://kettle.pentaho.org/) : you just define the .xls as your source, the database table as the table, some validation/filter rules if needed and trigger the loading process. Quite painless.

Excel spreadsheets can be saved as CVS or XML files and many RDBMS clients support importing these files directly into tables. This could allow you skip writing web service wrappers and migration scripts. Your database constraints would still be properly enforced during any import. If your RDBMS data model or schema is very different from your Excel spreadsheets, however, then some translation would of course have to take place via scripts or XSLT.\\n ... \\n[Ask question](/questions/ask)\\n\\nExplore related questions\\n\\n* [database](/questions/tagged/database \\\"show questions tagged 'database'\\\")\\n* [rdbms](/questions/tagged/rdbms \\\"show questions tagged 'rdbms'\\\")\\n* [spreadsheet](/questions/tagged/spreadsheet \\\"show questions tagged 'spreadsheet'\\\")\\n\\nSee similar questions with these tags.\\n ... \\n](/questions/2395607/when-to-switch-from-spreadsheet-to-rdbms?noredirect=1)\\n\\n#### Related\\n\\n[6](/questions/390784/how-do-you-typically-import-data-from-a-spreadsheet-to-multiple-database-columns \\\"Question score (upvotes - downvotes)\\\") [How do you typically import data from a spreadsheet to multiple database columns? ](/questions/390784/how-do-you-typically-import-data-from-a-spreadsheet-to-multiple-database-columns)\\n\\n[2](/questions/748807/best-way-to-gather-then-import-data-into-drupal \\\"Question score (upvotes - downvotes)\\\") [Best way to gather, then import data into drupal?\\n](/questions/748807/best-way-to-gather-then-import-data-into-drupal)\\n\\n[1](/questions/998410/store-spreadsheet-kind-of-data-in-sql-database \\\"Question score (upvotes - downvotes)\\\") [Store spreadsheet kind of data in SQL Database](/questions/998410/store-spreadsheet-kind-of-data-in-sql-database)\\n\\n[6](/questions/2395607/when-to-switch-from-spreadsheet-to-rdbms \\\"Question score (upvotes - downvotes)\\\") [When to switch from Spreadsheet to RDBMS?\\n](/questions/2395607/when-to-switch-from-spreadsheet-to-rdbms)\\n\\n[6](/questions/6906431/converting-rdf-to-sql-rdbms \\\"Question score (upvotes - downvotes)\\\") [Converting RDF to SQL/RDBMS](/questions/6906431/converting-rdf-to-sql-rdbms)\\n\\n[2](/questions/7042790/best-easiest-way-to-turn-an-excel-spreadsheet-into-a-queryable-database \\\"Question score (upvotes - downvotes)\\\") [best / easiest way to turn an excel spreadsheet into a queryable database](/questions/7042790/best-easiest-way-to-turn-an-excel-spreadsheet-into-a-queryable-database)\\n\\n[0](/questions/16435001/algorithm-to-migrate-database-records \\\"Question score (upvotes - downvotes)\\\") [Algorithm to migrate database records](/questions/16435001/algorithm-to-migrate-database-records)\\n\\n[0](/questions/35496971/how-can-i-translate-an-excel-table-into-a-relational-database-table-design \\\"Question score (upvotes - downvotes)\\\") [How can I translate an Excel table into a Relational Database Table Design?\\n](/questions/35496971/how-can-i-translate-an-excel-table-into-a-relational-database-table-design)\\n\\n[0](/questions/35648762/mapping-database-columns-to-excel-spreadsheet \\\"Question score (upvotes - downvotes)\\\") [Mapping database columns to excel spreadsheet](/questions/35648762/mapping-database-columns-to-excel-spreadsheet)\\n\\n[0](/questions/68378998/nosql-or-sql-or-other-tools-for-scaling-excel-spreadsheets \\\"Question score (upvotes - downvotes)\\\") [NoSQL or SQL or Other Tools for scaling excel spreadsheets](/questions/68378998/nosql-or-sql-or-other-tools-for-scaling-excel-spreadsheets)\\n\\n#### [Hot Network Questions](https://stackexchange.com/questions?tab=hot)\\n\\n* [macTeX suddenly installs a lot of updates and takes huge disk space](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/755441/mactex-suddenly-installs-a-lot-of-updates-and-takes-huge-disk-space)\\n* [When you see the whole set, the answer you'll\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73851265/adequate-database-structure-for-mixed-data\",\n      \"title\": \"Adequate database structure for mixed data - sql\",\n      \"publish_date\": null,\n      \"excerpts\": [\n        \"I have to create a database for sensor measurements.

Data traceability provides insights into data’s movement across pipeline stages, recording information about who accessed or modified data in its journey to help ensure accountability and compliance with security and privacy policies. Even though data traceability doesn’t factor in operational insights, such as delayed or failed jobs, it supports and complements other functionality required for achieving data quality, as we will explain in this article. The article also includes best practices and examples to help readers implement reliable data pipelines.\\n## **Summary of key data traceability concepts**\\n\\n|Concept |Description |\\n| --- | --- |\\n|Data Traceability |Tracks who accessed or modified data, when, and for what purpose to ensure accountability and compliance. |\\n|Data lineage |Visually maps how data flows between systems and tracks the dependencies between datasets to understand how they are related and used. |\\n|Pipeline traceability |Correlates data lineage with operational information like job execution, task dependencies, and operational inefficiencies to isolate bottlenecks and redundancies across the data journey. |\\n|Challenges in Data traceability |They include data anonymization, caching issues, and rotating data storage, among others. |\\n|Best practices for implementing data traceability |The recommendations include adopting the Medallion Architecture, pipeline traceability, and automated metadata management to maintain data quality and governance.\\n|\\n|Use Cases of data traceability |The practical applications of these techniques include detecting redundancies, identifying bottlenecks, enriching data catalogs, and applying sensitivity labeling for compliance. |\\n\\n## **What is data traceability? **\\n\\nData traceability ensures accountability and compliance by tracking who accessed or modified data, when, and for what purpose across its lifecycle. Unlike lineage, which maps data flows through the pipeline, traceability focuses on governance, ensuring events related to data access are logged and monitored. For example, if an analyst modifies a revenue metric, traceability records the access event, providing insight into the timing and context of the change. This helps teams quickly identify unauthorized access, incorrect usage, or faulty logic within processes. Imagine a sensitive customer record being incorrectly modified during a batch-processing job.\\nData traceability captures the access event, logging when the modification occurred and by whom. The data traceability functionality rests on having proper audit trails and meta-data management. * Audit trails offer a detailed record of every action taken on the data, ensuring accountability and transparency. By documenting who accessed the data, what changes were made, and when these actions occurred, audit trails help organizations maintain compliance and security. * Metadata Management provides context to data, making it easier to understand and trace. It organizes key information about data, such as its structure, format, and relationships to other datasets, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on accurate and relevant information. Data lineage complements data traceability by providing a visual diagram of how data flows and transforms across systems, tracing its journey from origin to destination.\\nThis visual representation helps organizations track data sources, transformations, and usage, offering valuable insights into the overall data pipeline. Let’s consider an example to illustrate how these concepts work together:\\n\\nWhen a customer service representative updates a customer's address in a CRM system, data Lineage shows the data's origin from a marketing database and its connection to sales records, tracing its journey. The audit trail provides a log registering that user A modified the table at a given date and time, ensuring accountability and enabling data traceability. Metadata Management provides context to data traceability records about the data structure and format, aiding with interpretation and analysis. Together, they enhance data governance, accountability, and integrity. However, while data lineage shows how sales and product data feed into a dashboard, it doesn’t catch errors during processing since it focuses on structural flows, not real-time job execution.\\n ... \\n* **Metadata and Logs** : Maintain detailed metadata and logs regarding the anonymization process, including timestamps and methods, to preserve an audit trail. **Data caching** temporarily stores information to enhance access speed and performance but can obscure changes in the original data, creating visibility gaps. **Solutions for Caching Challenges:**\\n\\n* **Cache Invalidation and Refresh Policies** : Establish policies to update cached data regularly, ensuring it reflects the current state of the source data. * **Logging Cache Access** : Record access details, including who accessed the cache and when to track usage patterns and maintain visibility. * **Synchronization Mechanisms** : Implement synchronization between the cache and the original data source to ensure alignment with the latest updates. **Rotating data storage** shifts information between locations for optimized performance or cost, complicating traceability.\\nTo minimize the impact of rotating storage, consider these strategies:\\n\\n* **Data Replication and Consistent Naming** : Replicate data across locations and maintain consistent naming conventions to facilitate tracking as it moves. * **Centralized Monitoring and Automated Tracking** : Use centralized monitoring tools and automated systems for real-time updates on data movements, enhancing traceability. * **Metadata Records** : Keep comprehensive metadata for each data transfer, including timestamps and locations, to ensure continuity in data lineage. **Best practices for implementing data traceability**\\n\\nBelow are the key best practices for achieving robust data traceability:\\n\\n### **Medallion Architecture**\\n\\nThe Medallion Architecture is considered a best practice for data traceability because it effectively implements key data traceability pillars through its structured three-layer design: Bronze, Silver, and Gold.\\nEach layer serves a specific purpose in managing data quality, transformations, and accessibility while reinforcing traceability by ensuring that data flows, changes, and usage are well-documented and transparent. The table below explains how the Medallion Architecture enhances data traceability across these layers. Diagram of the Medallion Architecture showing the three layers ( [source](https://medium.com/@mariusz_kujawski/exploring-the-medallion-architecture-in-microsoft-fabric-f19ad7590293) )\\n\\n|Layer |Purpose |Traceability Role |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|Bronze |Store raw data exactly as ingested. |Track data origin and ensure traceability of raw inputs. |\\n|Silver |Transform, clean, and enrich data for accuracy. |Track intermediate changes to ensure data evolution is traceable. |\\n|Gold |Provide curated, ready-for-use data for analytics. |Ensure high-quality outputs are accessible with complete trace logs.\\n ... \\nBelow are a few sample metrics stemming from pipeline traceability:\\n\\n|Metric |Description |Example |Type |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|Access lag time |Time between data access and logging the event |Alerts triggered within 2 minutes |Data Traceability |\\n|Data Extraction Latency |Time to extract data from the source system and make it available for transformation.\\n|Alerts if average extraction latency is more than 1 minute |Data Traceability |\\n|ETL job completion |Maximum time allowed for data transfers or jobs to complete |ETL job must be completed in under 15 minutes |Pipeline Traceability |\\n|MTTR (Mean Time to Resolution) |Average time to resolve data failures or bottlenecks |Support tickets closed in less than 30 minutes |Pipeline Traceability |\\n\\n## **Use cases of data traceability**\\n\\nThis section highlights how data traceability adds value beyond troubleshooting, which was covered in an earlier section, from spotting redundancies and bottlenecks to enriching data catalogs and enhancing access controls using detailed lineage insights. ### **Detecting Redundant or Inefficient Data Transformations**\\n\\nDetecting redundant or inefficient data transformations is a practical use case for data and pipeline traceability. Often, tasks like data cleaning or aggregation get repeated across different teams, leading to wasted resources and slow processing.\\nData traceability helps track who accessed or modified data, ensuring proper governance. |Team |Transformation stage |Redundancy risk identified |Action taken |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|Finance |Aggregation (monthly sales totals) |Similar aggregation is done by the marketing team |Consolidate to a shared job |\\n|Marketing |Cleaning (deduplication of user data) |Overlapping efforts with the sales team |Centralize data cleaning process |\\n|Data ops |Enrichment (currency conversion) |Re-applied conversion at different stages |Cache and reuse conversion results |\\n\\nPipeline traceability tools can monitor job logs and detect when multiple teams perform similar transformations independently. For example, the system can flag a redundancy if the finance and marketing teams calculate monthly sales totals independently. The company saves computing resources and streamlines data processing by consolidating these tasks into a shared job.\\nThe key metrics are:\\n\\n* **Task overlap logs:** Identify where tasks are duplicated, allowing teams to eliminate redundancies. * **Resource usage analysis:** Highlight inefficiencies, showing where optimization can cut costs. * **Efficiency gain tracking:** Measure improvements by reducing duplicate processing steps. ### **Enriching Data Catalogs**\\n\\nA data catalog is created by automatically scanning data sources to collect metadata, including schema details, data lineage, and usage statistics. It is enriched by user input and continuously updated to stay current as data changes. Data traceability adds value to a data catalog by logging access events, tracking modification history, and showing data lineage. For instance, if a data scientist sees that the marketing team recently modified the “Customer Purchase History” dataset to include promotional codes, this traceability insight alerts them to potential data changes, helping ensure accurate analysis.\\n ... \\nWhile lineage maps data flow and transformations (e.g., tracking sales data from an ERP application API to a report consumed by end-users), traceability adds deeper insights by showing who accessed or modified the data, when, and why—ensuring accountability and compliance. We also discussed pipeline traceability, which helps identify downstream impacts from pipeline failures by mapping dependencies between processes. Organizations can maintain efficient operations by addressing challenges like redundancies, bottlenecks, and cache refreshes with centralized monitoring. Adopting best practices such as Medallion Architecture and robust pipeline traceability strengthens data governance, helping teams detect issues early, make smarter decisions, and maintain high data quality.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/microsoft-365-apps/access/database-normalization-description\",\n      \"title\": \"Database normalization description - Microsoft 365 Apps\",\n      \"publish_date\": \"2025-06-25\",\n      \"excerpts\": [\n        \"[Skip to main content]() [Skip to Ask Learn chat experience](#)\\n\\nThis browser is no longer supported.

It includes creating tables and establishing relationships between those tables according to rules designed both to protect the data and to make the database more flexible by eliminating redundancy and inconsistent dependency. Redundant data wastes disk space and creates maintenance problems. If data that exists in more than one place must be changed, the data must be changed in exactly the same way in all locations. A customer address change is easier to implement if that data is stored only in the Customers table and nowhere else in the database. What is an \\\"inconsistent dependency\\\"? While it's intuitive for a user to look in the Customers table for the address of a particular customer, it may not make sense to look there for the salary of the employee who calls on that customer.\\nThe employee's salary is related to, or dependent on, the employee and thus should be moved to the Employees table. Inconsistent dependencies can make data difficult to access because the path to find the data may be missing or broken. There are a few rules for database normalization. Each rule is called a \\\"normal form.\\\" If the first rule is observed, the database is said to be in \\\"first normal form.\\\" If the first three rules are observed, the database is considered to be in \\\"third normal form.\\\" Although other levels of normalization are possible, third normal form is considered the highest level necessary for most applications. As with many formal rules and specifications, real world scenarios don't always allow for perfect compliance. In general, normalization requires additional tables and some customers find this cumbersome.\\nIf you decide to violate one of the first three rules of normalization, make sure that your application anticipates any problems that could occur, such as redundant data and inconsistent dependencies. The following descriptions include examples. ## First normal form\\n\\n* Eliminate repeating groups in individual tables. * Create a separate table for each set of related data. * Identify each set of related data with a primary key. Don't use multiple fields in a single table to store similar data. For example, to track an inventory item that may come from two possible sources, an inventory record may contain fields for Vendor Code 1 and Vendor Code 2. What happens when you add a third vendor? Adding a field isn't the answer; it requires program and table modifications and doesn't smoothly accommodate a dynamic number of vendors.\\nInstead, place all vendor information in a separate table called Vendors, then link inventory to vendors with an item number key, or vendors to inventory with a vendor code key. ## Second normal form\\n\\n* Create separate tables for sets of values that apply to multiple records. * Relate these tables with a foreign key. Records shouldn't depend on anything other than a table's primary key (a compound key, if necessary). For example, consider a customer's address in an accounting system. The address is needed by the Customers table, but also by the Orders, Shipping, Invoices, Accounts Receivable, and Collections tables. Instead of storing the customer's address as a separate entry in each of these tables, store it in one place, either in the Customers table or in a separate Addresses table. ## Third normal form\\n\\n* Eliminate fields that don't depend on the key. Values in a record that aren't part of that record's key don't belong in the table.\\nIn general, anytime the contents of a group of fields may apply to more than a single record in the table, consider placing those fields in a separate table. For example, in an Employee Recruitment table, a candidate's university name and address may be included. But you need a complete list of universities for group mailings. If university information is stored in the Candidates table, there is no way to list universities with no current candidates. Create a separate Universities table and link it to the Candidates table with a university code key. EXCEPTION: Adhering to the third normal form, while theoretically desirable, isn't always practical. If you have a Customers table and you want to eliminate all possible interfield dependencies, you must create separate tables for cities, ZIP codes, sales representatives, customer classes, and any other factor that may be duplicated in multiple records. In theory, normalization is worth pursuing.\\nHowever, many small tables may degrade performance or exceed open file and memory capacities. It may be more feasible to apply third normal form only to data that changes frequently. If some dependent fields remain, design your application to require the user to verify all related fields when any one is changed. ## Other normalization forms\\n\\nFourth normal form, also called Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF), and fifth normal form do exist, but are rarely considered in practical design. Disregarding these rules may result in less than perfect database design, but shouldn't affect functionality. ## Normalizing an example table\\n\\nThese steps demonstrate the process of normalizing a fictitious student table. 1. Unnormalized table:\\n   \\n   |Student# |Advisor |Adv-Room |Class1 |Class2 |Class3 |\\n   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n   |1022 |Jones |412 |101-07 |143-01 |159-02 |\\n   |4123 |Smith |216 |101-07 |143-01 |179-04 |\\n2.\\nFirst normal form: No repeating groups\\n   \\n   Tables should have only two dimensions. Since one student has several classes, these classes should be listed in a separate table. Fields Class1, Class2, and Class3 in the above records are indications of design trouble. Spreadsheets often use the third dimension, but tables shouldn't. Another way to look at this problem is with a one-to-many relationship, don't put the one side and the many sides in the same table. Instead, create another table in first normal form by eliminating the repeating group (Class#), as shown in the following example:\\n   \\n   |Student# |Advisor |Adv-Room |Class# |\\n   | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n   |1022 |Jones |412 |101-07 |\\n   |1022 |Jones |412 |143-01 |\\n   |1022 |Jones |412 |159-02 |\\n   |4123 |Smith |216 |101-07 |\\n   |4123 |Smith |216 |143-01 |\\n   |4123 |Smith |216 |179-04 |\\n3. Second normal form: Eliminate redundant data\\n   \\n   Note the multiple **Class#** values for each **Student#** value in the above table.\\nClass# isn't functionally dependent on Student# (primary key), so this relationship isn't in second normal form.

For example this current case I'm struggling with is a column called \\\"opts\\\" which is an integer array. Depending on a type that is not even present in the current row, you have to join another table to find that out, this column may contain:\\n\\n* a 0 or a 1 - meaning an on/off state\\n* a list of IDs from a table\\n* a list of IDs from a second table\\n* null in any other case\\n\\nTo me this looks more like clutter than organized data. So is there a database design concept that this violates or is it just my OCD? What should my arguments be when I try to persuade him not to do this anymore?\\nI'd like to add that the IDs in the table do not need foreign keys for reasons that are not worth getting into, the colleague does this with other stuff too, for ex another column in another table has either a string or a json text. What I'd do in these cases is to have more columns, one for each case, and complete only one of them and leave the rest as null. * [database-design](/questions/tagged/database-design \\\"show questions tagged 'database-design'\\\")\\n\\n[Share](/q/321543 \\\"Short permalink to this question\\\")\\n\\n[Improve this question](/posts/321543/edit)\\n\\nFollow\\n\\nasked Dec 29, 2022 at 17:56\\n\\n[](/users/149413/soger)\\n\\n[soger](/users/149413/soger)\\n\\n123 1 1 silver badge 3 3 bronze badges\\n\\n2\\n\\n* To be honest, I used to do that when the hard disk size was 40M. Yes that's correct. Space was a premium. But I stopped two decades ago. Queries and Reports are so much cleaner and easier with multiple columns.

In this case, we would add an age column to the table but value in that column would only have meaning for some of the rows in the table, this can quickly become messy and difficult to work with.\\nSome thoughts on why OTLT plus storing comma delimited lists is bad\\n\\nFor ease of explanation, I am going to say you have a row which has a list of PersonIDs that are stored in this table for some reason and that you have a separate person table where PersonID is unique\\n\\n* Lack of constraint - if a particular entity type requires a 1 or a 0 but the column is VARCHAR, there is nothing to stop some other illegal value being entered such as 'abc' (perhaps a CHECK constraint but these are likely to become complicated,prone to error and need update everytime a new category is created)\\n* If we need to join to the person table to get any information about the one or more persons in the ID list, we are going to have to do a string split which can be awful for performance, it also relies on the comma delimted list being entered in a standard format\\n* We can't easily see all the people in the person table who are not listed in this table (again, we would achieve this through a left anti join)\\n*\\nIndexing will be almost impossible\\n* It is more likely that the table will cause a blocking problem in your database as more queries will use it, most will be inefficient and slow for the reasons mentioned above meaning the locks will be longer and waiting queries will wait longer\\n* You mention the data doesn't need to be a foreign key but if it does in the future, you have a job on your hands to change the database schema\\n* Storage - assuming this column is VARCHAR, the storage requirements will be greater than if the correct data types were used (storing a 1 or 0 as a BIT data type costs 1 byte, VARCHAR would cost 3)\\n* Dependant on the length of the VARCHAR column, this could massively increase the amount of memory required to run queries - if SQL Server needs to sort this column, it assumes each row holds a VARCHAR value half the size of the varchar length and uses this estimate to grant the appropriate amount of memory.\\nIf your column is VARCHAR(MAX) and the query optimizer needs to sort this column, your server could quickly run out memory and new queries would have to wait until existing ones complete (Known as RESOURCE\\\\_SEMAPHORE waits)\\n* You are likely to introduce implicit conversions when comparing the column to something else which is usually bad for estimation and can cause numerous performance issues\\n* Permissions - what if I want a user to be able to update Departments but not people but they are both stored in the same table? As for design concepts, comma delimted lists violate [first normal form](https://www.1keydata.com/database-normalization/first-normal-form-1nf.php) and OTLT potentially violates [second normal form](https://www.1keydata.com/database-normalization/second-normal-form-2nf.php)\\n\\nFWIW, I have lived through the pain these patterns cause and they are just pure nasty IMO.\\nConvincing those that create them to rip them out will probably require tests that evidence those bullets points above - when testing, don't neccesarily think how much data you have now, think 1, 3, 5 years time\\n\\n[Share](/a/321553 \\\"Short permalink to this answer\\\")\\n\\n[Improve this answer](/posts/321553/edit)\\n\\nFollow\\n\\n[edited Dec 30, 2022 at 0:26](/posts/321553/revisions \\\"show all edits to this post\\\")\\n\\nanswered Dec 30, 2022 at 0:13\\n\\n[](/users/134691/se1986)\\n\\n[SE1986](/users/134691/se1986)\\n\\n2,256 4 4 gold badges 31 31 silver badges 63 63 bronze badges\\n\\n0\\n\\n[Add a comment](# \\\"Use comments to ask for more information or suggest improvements.

A Complete Guide for 2025\\n\\nLast updated on\\n\\n•\\n\\n5 min read\\n\\n[Roman Vinogradov](/blog-authors/roman-vinogradov)\\n\\nVP of Products, Improvado\\n\\n[](#) [](#) [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roman-v-46a599143/) [](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Roman-Vinogradov-Vice-President-Product-Improvado/d4dafd57-1b54-48f3-bd55-a17de7d085b0)\\n\\nWhen data flows in from dozens of platforms, each with its own schema, naming logic, and metric definitions, even small inconsistencies propagate into broken joins, unreliable attribution models, and misaligned financial reporting. Normalization isn't about “cleaning data.” It’s about enforcing structural and semantic consistency so downstream analytics, modeling, and governance operate on stable ground.\\nThis article details modern normalization design patterns, covers how to configure normalized layers in warehouse-native architectures, maintain schema integrity as systems evolve, and support advanced workloads like media mix modeling, incrementality testing, and AI-driven optimization. ### Key Takeaways\\n\\n* **Reduces Redundancy:** Data normalization minimizes duplicate data, saving storage space and preventing inconsistencies. * **Improves Integrity:** It ensures that data is reliable and consistent by eliminating anomalies related to data insertion, updates, and deletion. * **Two Main Contexts:** Normalization means different things for databases (organizing data to prevent issues) and machine learning (scaling data features for better model performance). * **The Normal Forms:** Database normalization follows a series of guidelines called normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF) that progressively reduce redundancy. * **Manual vs.\\nAutomated:** While you can normalize data manually using tools like Python or Excel, it's often inefficient and prone to errors. Automated tools like Improvado offer a scalable, accurate, and modern solution. ## Why Is Data Normalization Crucial for Your Business? Think of an unorganized warehouse where the same product is stored in multiple locations under different names. Finding anything would be a nightmare, and you'd have no accurate inventory count. An unnormalized database is the digital equivalent of this chaos. When your data is not normalized, you face significant challenges. Reports become unreliable because the same metric might be calculated differently across datasets. Simple queries become complex and slow, draining your engineering resources. Most importantly, you can't trust the insights derived from your data, which undermines your entire data strategy. [Data normalization](https://improvado.io/products/transform-model) cleans up this mess.\\nIt acts as a set of rules and a system of organization for your data warehouse, ensuring every piece of information is stored logically and efficiently. By implementing normalization, you create a stable foundation for all your analytics, reporting, and data-driven initiatives, ensuring that the insights you generate are accurate and actionable. Eliminate Manual Data Prep With Automated Marketing Data Normalization\\n\\nImprovado delivers automated normalization for all marketing, sales, and revenue data. The platform applies structured normalization rules, AI-powered field mapping, and governed taxonomies across your ecosystem, ensuring every metric and campaign label matches across sources. Pre-filter extraction reduces noise at the source, while audit trails and versioning guarantee full transparency and data trust. Give your analysts clean, analysis-ready data without the manual work.\\n ... \\nWe only go into the platform now to handle a backend refresh if naming conventions change or something. That's it._\\n\\n_With Improvado, we now trust the data. If anything is wrong, it’s how someone on the team is viewing it, not the data itself. It’s 99.9% accurate.”_\\n\\nTyler Corcoran [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyler-corcoran-ba465272/)\\n\\nMarketing Analytics Manager at Booyah Advertising\\n\\n### Prevents Data Anomalies (Update, Insert, Delete)\\n\\nData anomalies are errors that occur in a database when it is not properly structured. Normalization helps prevent three main types of anomalies:\\n\\n* **Insertion Anomaly:** This happens when you can't add a new record because some data is missing. For example, if you can't add a new sales agent to a table until they are assigned a customer, because the customer ID is part of the primary key. * **Update Anomaly:** This occurs when you have to update the same piece of redundant data in multiple places.\\nIf you miss even one instance, your data becomes inconsistent. For example, updating a product name in 100 different sales records instead of just once in a product table. * **Deletion Anomaly:** This is the unintentional loss of data. If customer details are only stored within their order records, deleting a customer's final order would also erase all information about that customer from the database. ### Simplifies Queries and Improves Analysis\\n\\nWhile it may seem counterintuitive, a well-normalized database with multiple tables is often easier and faster to query. The data is organized logically, so queries are more straightforward to write and execute more efficiently. This allows analysts to retrieve the information they need quickly, speeding up the entire process of generating reports and uncovering valuable business insights.

While both aim to organize data, their goals and methods are fundamentally different. ### Database Normalization: The Normal Forms\\n\\nIn database management, normalization is a systematic approach to designing a relational database to eliminate data redundancy and preserve data integrity. The process involves dividing larger tables into smaller, well-structured tables and defining relationships between them. This structure is guided by a set of rules known as normal forms. The core principle is functional dependency, where the value of one attribute (or column) in a table is determined by the value of another attribute. #### First Normal Form (1NF)\\n\\nThe first and most basic rule of normalization.\\n ... \\nEnterprise environments typically combine Python with automated pipelines, data quality monitoring, and governed mapping frameworks. ### How to Normalize Data in Excel\\n\\nYou can also perform basic normalization directly in Excel, which is useful for quick analyses without coding. To perform Z-score standardization, you would follow these steps:\\n\\n* **Calculate the Mean:** In an empty cell, use the AVERAGE() function on your data column. * **Calculate the Standard Deviation:** In another cell, use the STDEV.P() or STDEV.S() function on the same column. * **Apply the Formula:** In a new column, apply the Z-score formula =(cell - mean) / standard\\\\_deviation for each value. Make sure to use absolute references ($) for the mean and standard deviation cells so you can drag the formula down. ## Common Challenges of Data Normalization\\n\\nWhile normalization is powerful, it's not without its challenges. Over-normalizing a database (e.g., to 4NF or 5NF) can create a large number of tables.\\nThis can increase query complexity, as you need to perform more JOIN operations to retrieve data, potentially slowing down read-heavy applications. This performance trade-off is why some systems, particularly data warehouses built for fast reporting and analytics, use a strategy called _denormalization_ . Denormalization is the process of intentionally adding redundant data back into a database to optimize query performance. The key is finding the right balance between normalization for data integrity and denormalization for analytical speed. Managing this balance manually requires deep expertise and constant maintenance. ## Automated Data Normalization Tools: The Modern Solution\\n\\nManually normalizing data is not a scalable solution for modern enterprises. As you add more data sources, the complexity of managing schemas, dependencies, and transformations grows exponentially. This is where automated data normalization tools become essential.\\n ... \\nWhile manual methods in Python and Excel have their place for smaller tasks, they cannot meet the demands of a growing enterprise. The complexity and scale of modern data ecosystems require a robust, automated solution. An automated marketing analytics platform like [Improvado](https://improvado.io/products/transform-model) is essential for organizations that need to scale their analytics, prove ROI, and maintain strong data governance without dedicating extensive engineering resources to building and maintaining custom data pipelines. By handling the complexities of normalization automatically, Improvado empowers you to focus on what truly matters: extracting actionable insights that drive business growth. ‍\\n\\n## FAQ\\n\\n### What are the best AI-powered tools for data normalization?\\nTop AI-powered tools for data normalization include Trifacta, which uses machine learning for automatic data cleaning and structuring, and Talend, which provides AI-driven data preparation with smart suggestions.
