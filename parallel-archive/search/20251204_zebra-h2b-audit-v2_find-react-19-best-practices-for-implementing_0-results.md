Happy reading if you're curious about why, while I hide under a table, just in case. 😅\\n\\n## Why Do You Want to Make a State Management Decision? So, what is the best state management solution... First things first: why do you want to know? No, really. There is no such thing as \\\"the best\\\" anything. It always, always depends. (Except for ice cream. Pistachio ice cream is the best). If you simply want to learn something new to add to your CV and improve your job searching chances, then learn the most popular libraries. [\\\"State of React\\\"](https://stateofreact.com/en-US) and similar surveys are your friends here. Or even better - open the job descriptions of the company you're trying to apply for and extract those names from there. Or even betterer (more better?\\n🤔) learn the [core](https://react.dev/) and [advanced](https://www.advanced-react.com/) React concepts, like how re-renders and reconciliation work, for example. All state management libraries then become the same to you, just a matter of expressing the same concept in a slightly different way. If you work on an existing old and large project, are unhappy with your current state management solution being Redux, and want to introduce something better, then you also don't need \\\"the best\\\" library. The most important thing in this case would be to understand why the current library makes you unhappy. The last thing you want to do is replace a well-known solution with something that does things very differently, requires a huge investment into upskilling colleagues, and doesn't solve the problem you promised to solve. A good example here would be trying to replace Redux with something like XState in an attempt to solve the \\\"Redux is too complicated\\\" problem.\\n ... \\nEven the simplest \\\"fetch and render\\\" situation is not as easy as it seems. The UI should be able to handle at the very least three states of the data: no data yet, data is loading, and data is finally here. But then, something can happen while the data is loading, like a server being down. So you need to add a way to handle failure here. You also don't want to trigger fetching multiple times if two or more components want to fetch from exactly the same endpoint. Oh, and by the way, if you fetched that data on one page, you'd probably want to cache it so it can be reused on another page. Although you'd probably want to implement some mechanisms to refresh that cache from time to time to avoid stale data. Or clean it completely. And speaking of cache. Surely you'd want to avoid [request waterfalls](https://www.developerway.com/posts/how-to-fetch-data-in-react) , right?\\nWhen a request for data is trapped inside a conditionally rendered component that only kicks off when another completely irrelevant request has finished. In this case, you'd want to parallelize those requests, pre-fetch the hidden data, put it into cache, and extract it from the cache when the need arises. I'm still talking about \\\"fetch, render, and forget\\\" use cases, by the way! But what if you need to fetch that data as a response to user interaction? You'd add [race conditions](https://www.developerway.com/posts/fetching-in-react-lost-promises) and the fight with them to the mix. And you're in a world of pain if the data can be _modified_ , especially if you want to add the concept of \\\"optimistic update\\\" to the mix while preserving data integrity. So if you're trying to migrate an older app from Redux, chances are, ~80% of your Redux-related code handles everything above. In this case, you don't need a state management library. You need a good React-first data management library.\\nSomething that solves everything mentioned above, is actively maintained, has a good reputation, good documentation, and is stable. I.e., at the very least, > 1.x version and no major version rewrites every 6 months. My default choice for this use case is [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview) (formerly known as React Query). Told you, it will be opinions, not a \\\"let's investigate\\\" article! But really, try migrating to it from a legacy Redux-based custom solution if you haven't tried it. You'll cry happy tears, your life will never be the same, and 80% of your code will be just gone. Want to fetch some data in a component while being mindful of loading and error states? Easy:\\n\\n```\\n```\\nfunction Component ( ) {\\n\\nconst { isPending , error , data } = useQuery ( {\\n\\nqueryKey : [ 'my-data' ] ,\\n\\nqueryFn : ( ) => fetch ( 'https://my-url/data' ) . then ( ( res ) => res .\\n ... \\nUse [nuqs](https://nuqs.dev/) library instead. Same as with TanStack Query being a game-changer for remote state, this beautiful but obscurely named library is a game-changer for managing query params. Here's what syncing our onboarding state with the URL will look like with this library:\\n\\n```\\n```\\nexport function MyApp ( ) {\\n\\nconst [ step , setStep ] = useQueryState ( 'onboarding' ) ;\\n\\nreturn (\\n\\n< >\\n\\n< button onClick = { ( ) => setStep ( 'step2' ) } > Next Step </ button >\\n\\n</ >\\n\\n) ;\\n\\n}\\n```\\n```\\n\\nFor tabs, do you want to default to `1` if the param is not present and be an actual number, not a string? Sure:\\n\\n```\\n```\\nexport function MyApp ( ) {\\n\\nconst [ tab , setTab ] = useQueryState ( 'tab' , parseAsInteger . withDefault ( 1 ) ) ;\\n\\nreturn (\\n\\n< >\\n\\n< button onClick = { ( ) => setTab ( 2 ) } > Second tab </ button >\\n\\n</ >\\n\\n) ;\\n\\n}\\n```\\n```\\n\\nIf you ever implemented any of the above manually, you'll cry right now.\\n ... \\nBut if you're starting a new project from scratch, there is zero reason to introduce a new library for concerns like this. This conversation, however, starts getting interesting when you need to **_share_** some of that state between different components. ## Shared State\\n\\nImagine, for example, an app with a collapsible panel on the left and a few ways to expand/collapse that panel:\\n\\n* By clicking a hovering button at the right edge of that panel. * By dragging the panel with the mouse by its edges. * By clicking a button with a corresponding \\\"expand\\\" or \\\"collapse\\\" icon in the top bar. * Via a keyboard shortcut. * By entering a \\\"full-screen\\\" edit mode in the app, either by clicking a button or via a keyboard shortcut. In other words, a bunch of components from very different parts of the app, that don't even know about each other, want to know and control our sidebar's most personal information. ~~Just like social media platforms~~ .\\n ... \\n```\\n```\\nconst SmallToggleSidebarButton = ( ) => {\\n\\nconst { isSidebarOpen , setIsSidebarOpen } = useSidebarContext ( ) ;\\n\\nreturn (\\n\\n< button\\n\\nonClick = { ( ) => setIsSidebarOpen ( ! isSidebarOpen ) }\\n\\n>\\n\\nToggle Sidebar\\n\\n</ button >\\n\\n) ;\\n\\n} ;\\n```\\n```\\n\\nAnd since \\\"toggle\\\" functionality is pretty standard, I can even implement it as a predefined API available to everyone who uses SidebarContext:\\n\\n```\\n```\\nconst SidebarProvider = ( { children } ) => {\\n\\nconst [ isSidebarOpen , setIsSidebarOpen ] = React . useState ( false ) ;\\n\\nconst value = React . useMemo (\\n\\n( ) => ( {\\n\\nisSidebarOpen ,\\n\\nsetIsSidebarOpen ,\\n\\n// Introduce the \\\"toggle\\\" API\\n\\ntoggleSidebar : ( ) => setIsSidebarOpen ( ( prev ) => !\\nprev ) ,\\n\\n} ) ,\\n\\n[ isSidebarOpen ] ,\\n\\n) ;\\n\\nreturn ... // same as before\\n\\n} ;\\n```\\n```\\n\\nAnd then use it in the button:\\n\\n```\\n```\\nconst SmallToggleSidebarButton = ( ) => {\\n\\nconst { toggleSidebar } = useSidebarContext ( ) ;\\n\\nreturn (\\n\\n< button\\n\\nonClick = { ( ) => toggleSidebar ( ) }\\n\\n>\\n\\nToggle Sidebar\\n\\n</ button >\\n\\n) ;\\n\\n} ;\\n```\\n```\\n\\nThe benefits of this approach, compared to prop drilling, are great! The code is readable and clean. No more unnecessary props. Refactoring that state doesn't mean a complete rewrite anymore. I'd need to change only the components that actually use it. And if you don't expose the state directly, but instead create a sensible API, like the `toggleSidebar` function, you might not need to refactor anything other than the provider's implementation itself! The code is highly contained, which is always good. Even performance could potentially improve, despite what you might hear about Context being bad for performance.\\n ... \\nThe bigger problem here is **performance** . Or **re-renders** caused by the state change inside the provider, to be precise. You see, the problem with Context is that when its value changes, _every single user of the Context_ re-renders. All of them! Regardless of whether they use the part of the state that changed or not. In the example above, that would mean that `SmallToggleSidebarButton` re-renders even if the `sidebar` state didn't change, but `theming` did. And vice versa. With a somewhat complicated and widespread state like the above, that means that on every interaction, the entire app re-renders. This could be okay if the app is small. Or you might end up with the sidebar freezing for a few seconds on every interaction. Your users won't like that. No premature optimization and measure first, of course.\\n ... \\nFirst of all, we eliminated like 80% of the state management concerns in an average app by choosing a data management library ( [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) , [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) ). Then we removed another 10% by moving URL state to [nuqs](https://github.com/47ng/nuqs) . Only 10% left! Considering that, the very first thing I'm going to look for in a shared state solution is simplicity. There really isn't much to handle in those 10%, so I really need something here that doesn't consume my brain resources. I need something that is dead simple to set up and does not introduce its own unique and abstract terminology. I want to look at the code and infer intuitively what it means and what to expect without opening the docs of the library. Everything that implies that \\\"you need to forget everything you learned\\\" or introduces some \\\"new, conceptual way of thinking\\\" immediately goes to the bin.\\n ... \\nAnything coming from a backend, API, database, etc., could be handled by a data-fetching library. [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) or [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) are the most popular choices these days. They solve caching, deduplication, invalidation, retries, pagination, optimistic updates, and many more, and likely much better than any manual implementation. * **Query params in URL state** . If your router doesn't support syncing those with local state, use [nuqs](https://nuqs.dev/docs/installation) and save yourself massive pain implementing that sync manually. * **Local state** . A lot of the state doesn't need to be shared, actually. It's just something that comes from overusing Redux in the past. Use React's `useState` or `useReducer` in this case. * **Shared state** . This is the state that you want to share between different loosely related components. You can use simple prop drilling techniques for that, or Context when prop drilling becomes a nuisance.\\nOnly when Context is not enough do the state management libraries become useful. Do this, and you'll find that ~90% of your state management problems simply disappear. The leftover state is small, predictable, and much easier to reason about. And the best state management library for it is... There is no such thing. Define what criteria are important to you and evaluate your choices based on that. In my case, Zustand is my choice because it's very simple, actively maintained, and aligned with the \\\"React\\\" way of doing things. Yours can be radically different. And it's totally fine. ### Table of Contents\\n\\n1. [Why Do You Want to Make a State Management Decision? ]()\\n2. [State Concerns That Don't Need a State Management Library]()\\n   \\n    1.

[React](https://react.dev/) has come a long way since its [first release in 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW0rj4sNH2w) . What began as a library for building user interfaces has evolved into a comprehensive ecosystem for developing modern web applications. With [React 19’s](https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19) stable release in late 2024 and the continued maturation of the ecosystem, developers now have access to powerful features that streamline development workflows and enhance application performance. In this article, we’ll explore React design patterns and best practices for 2025.\\nWe’ll examine how modern component patterns, state management approaches, TypeScript integration and the latest React 19 features can help you build more robust and maintainable applications. ## Modern Component Patterns\\n\\n### Function Components as the Standard\\n\\nFunction components have become the de facto standard for React development, replacing [class components](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component) for practically all use cases. This shift reflects React’s move toward a more functional programming paradigm, emphasizing simplicity and composability. ```\\nfunction UserProfile ( {  userId  } ) { const [ user ,  setUser ] = useState ( null ) ; const [ loading ,  setLoading ] = useState ( true ) ; useEffect ( ( ) => { async function fetchUser ( ) { setLoading ( true ) ; try { const  userData  = await fetchUserData ( userId ) ; setUser ( userData ) ; } catch ( error ) { \\n        console .\\n ... \\n**  \\n> Check out [this guide to useState](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/react-usestate-hook) and [this deep dive on useEffect](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/breakdown-react-useeffect-hook) to better understand how they power function components. > \\n> \\n\\n### Custom Hooks for Logic Reusability\\n\\nCustom hooks represent one of the most powerful patterns in modern React development. They enable the extraction of stateful logic into reusable functions, promoting code reuse and separation of concerns. In the example below, a `useFormInput` custom hook manages form input state and behavior, allowing components to reuse this consistent input logic easily. ```\\n// Custom hook for handling form input function useFormInput ( initialValue ) { const [ value ,  setValue ] = useState ( initialValue ) ; function handleChange ( e ) { setValue ( e . target .\\n ... \\n## State Management\\n\\n### Context API for Application-Wide State\\n\\nThe Context API has matured into a reasonable solution for managing application-wide state, reducing the need for external state management libraries. With React 19, the [Context API](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) has become even more powerful by introducing the [use function](https://react.dev/reference/react/use) for accessing context values. ```\\n// Creating a context const  ThemeContext  = createContext ( { \\n  theme : \\\"light\\\" , \\n  toggleTheme : ( ) => { } , } ) ; // Provider component function ThemeProvider ( {  children  } ) { const [ theme ,  setTheme ] = useState ( \\\"light\\\" ) ; const toggleTheme = ( ) => { setTheme ( ( prevTheme ) => ( prevTheme  === \\\"light\\\" ?\\n\\\"dark\\\" : \\\"light\\\" ) ) ; } ; const  value  = {  theme ,  toggleTheme  } ; return < ThemeContext value = { value } > { children } </ ThemeContext > ; } // Using context with the new 'use' API in React 19 function ThemedButton ( {  variant  } ) { // We can use the 'use' function in conditional blocks if ( variant  === \\\"primary\\\" ) { const {  theme ,  toggleTheme  } = use ( ThemeContext ) ; return ( < button className = { `btn- ${ variant } ${ theme } ` }  onClick = { toggleTheme } > \\n        Toggle Theme\\n       </ button > ) ; } return < button className = { `btn- ${ variant } ` } > Regular Button </ button > ; }\\n```\\n\\nThe above example sets up a theme context and provider, allowing components like `ThemedButton` to access and update the current theme using the new `use()` API introduced in React 19. The Context API is well-suited for theme management, user authentication, localization and feature flags across an application.\\n ... \\n### Type-Safe Components and Props\\n\\nTypeScript enables the creation of type-safe components with well-defined props interfaces:\\n\\n```\\n// Defining prop types interface UserCardProps { \\n  user : { \\n    id :  number , \\n    name :  string , \\n    email :  string , \\n    role : \\\"admin\\\" | \\\"user\\\" | \\\"guest\\\" , \\n    profileImage ? :  string , } ; \\n  onEdit ? : ( userId :  number ) => void ; \\n  variant ? : \\\"compact\\\" | \\\"detailed\\\" ; } // Type-safe component function UserCard ( {  user ,  onEdit ,  variant  = \\\"detailed\\\" } :  UserCardProps ) { return ( < div className = { `user-card  ${ variant } ` } > { user . profileImage  && ( < img src = { user . profileImage }  alt = { ` ${ user . name } 's profile` } / > ) } < h3 > { user . name } </ h3 > { variant  === \\\"detailed\\\" && ( < > < p > { user . email } </ p > < p > Role : { user . role } </ p > < / > ) } { onEdit  && < button onClick = { ( ) => onEdit ( user .\\nid ) } > Edit </ button > } </ div > ) ; }\\n```\\n\\nThe above example defines a strongly typed component using a `UserCardProps` interface, so the props passed to `UserCard` are validated at compile time. ### Type-Safe Hooks\\n\\nTypeScript enhances React hooks by providing type safety for state, effects and custom hooks:\\n\\n```\\nfunction  useLocalStorage < T > ( key :  string ,  initialValue :  T ) : [ T , ( value :  T ) => void ] { const [ storedValue ,  setStoredValue ] =  useState < T > ( ( ) => { try { const  item  =  window . localStorage . getItem ( key ) ; return  item  ? JSON . parse ( item ) :  initialValue ; } catch ( error ) { \\n      console . error ( error ) ; return  initialValue ; } } ) ; const setValue = ( value :  T ) => { try { setStoredValue ( value ) ; \\n      window . localStorage . setItem ( key ,  JSON . stringify ( value ) ) ; } catch ( error ) { \\n      console .\\n ... \\n**  \\n> Explore [Mastering TypeScript: Benefits and Best Practices](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/mastering-typescript-benefits-best-practices) for an introductory foundation, and dive into [How To Easily Understand TypeScript Generics](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/easily-understand-typescript-generics) to better understand generics and what they offer. > \\n> \\n\\n## React 19 and Ecosystem Updates\\n\\n### New Hooks\\n\\nReact 19 introduced several new hooks, which include [useActionState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useActionState) , [useFormStatus](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/hooks/useFormStatus) , [useOptimistic](https://react.dev/reference/react/useOptimistic) and the new [use API](https://react.dev/reference/react/use) . These hooks provide elegant solutions for everyday tasks like form handling and optimistic UI updates.\\n ... \\ncontent } </ div > ) ) } </ div > </ form > ) ; }\\n```\\n\\nIn the example above, the `useOptimistic` hook immediately displays a new message in the UI _before_ the network request completes, providing a smoother and faster user experience through optimistic updates. ### React Server Components\\n\\n[React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) represent a significant paradigm shift in how React applications are structured and rendered. They enable components to run exclusively on the server, accessing data sources directly without client-side API calls and reducing JavaScript bundle sizes.\\n ... \\nTogether, they separate data fetching from interactivity which can optimize performance and user experience. > **💡Want a more complete rundown of what’s new in React 19? **  \\n> Check out our previous article, [What’s New in React 19](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/whats-new-react-19) , for a detailed look at the latest hooks, the `use()` API, server components and other key updates introduced in the latest React release. > \\n> \\n\\n## Frameworks\\n\\nThe modern React ecosystem has evolved significantly, with frameworks playing a critical role in elevating developer experience and application performance. In 2025, three solutions often stand out in the React development landscape: Next.js, Remix and Vite. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) offers a comprehensive solution for building React applications. It offers flexible [rendering strategies](https://nextjs.org/learn/seo/rendering-strategies) , built-in support for API routes and full-stack capabilities.\\nFeatures like automatic image optimization and Incremental Static Regeneration contribute to performance and scalability for complex applications. [Remix](https://remix.run/) emphasizes web fundamentals and progressive enhancement. Its [routing system](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/discussion/routes) combines data loading and UI rendering through nested routes. It strongly uses browser-native features and HTTP conventions and provides smooth transitions through built-in support for loading states and optimistic UI patterns. [Vite](https://vite.dev/) can be used as a standalone build tool or as a powerful complement to frameworks like Remix. It transforms the development workflow with near-instantaneous startup times and rapid [hot module replacement](https://vite.dev/guide/features.html) . By leveraging native ES modules during development, Vite eliminates the need for bundling in the dev cycle, allowing servers to start in milliseconds rather than minutes.\\nWhether used independently or alongside a framework, Vite offers a fast, modern development experience without compromising performance. ## Component Libraries and Design Systems\\n\\n### The Rise of Utility-First CSS with Tailwind\\n\\n[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) has become a popular choice for styling in React applications, fundamentally shifting how developers approach component design. This utility-first CSS framework provides low-level utility classes that can be composed directly in JSX markup, eliminating the need for separate CSS files and reducing context-switching during development. ```\\nfunction ProductCard ( {  product  } ) { return ( < div className = \\\" bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md overflow-hidden duration-300 \\\" > < img src = { product . imageUrl } alt = { product . name } className = \\\" w-full h-48 object-cover \\\" /> < div className = \\\" p-4 \\\" > < h3 className = \\\" text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2 \\\" > { product .\\n ... \\n### Professional UI Component Libraries: KendoReact\\n\\nWhile utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind excel at building custom interfaces, enterprise applications can sometimes require complex components with sophisticated behaviors and accessibility features. This is where professional UI libraries like Progress [KendoReact](/kendo-react-ui) shine. KendoReact offers a comprehensive suite of UI components for React applications, covering everything from essential building blocks like [Buttons](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/buttons/button) and [Dialogs](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/dialogs/dialog) to advanced, highly specialized components like [Charts](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/charts) and [Data Grids](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/grid) . In 2025, KendoReact has continued to evolve with regular updates, expanding its component offerings while maintaining backward compatibility.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61314987/react-highly-rely-on-url-params-to-determine-what-to-show-on-the-page-is-it-r\",\n      \"title\": \"reactjs - React - highly rely on url params to determine what to show ...\",\n      \"publish_date\": \"2020-04-20\",\n      \"excerpts\": [\n        \"useParams -This hook gives us access to the params of that particular route.

To fully leverage these features, it’s important to follow modern best practices. This guide walks through tips, patterns, and strategies to write **clean, maintainable, and high-performance React 19 apps** . * * *\\n\\n## []() 1\\\\. Embrace Automatic Memoization\\n\\nReact 19’s **React Compiler** automatically memoizes components, reducing unnecessary re-renders. **Best Practices:**\\n\\n* Remove redundant `React.memo` , `useMemo` , and `useCallback` where not needed\\n* Keep components small and focused to maximize compiler optimizations\\n\\n```\\n// Small, focused component function UserCard ({ user }) { return < p > { user . name } </ p >; }\\n```\\n\\n**Tip:** Measure performance with React Profiler to see where manual memoization may still be needed. * * *\\n\\n## []() 2\\\\.\\nUse Async-Safe Context\\n\\nWith the new `use()` hook, React 19 allows context to be **used safely in async boundaries** . **Best Practices:**\\n\\n* Use context only for **global/shared state** (theme, auth, language)\\n* Avoid storing frequently changing data in context — prefer local state for dynamic updates\\n\\n```\\nconst ThemeContext = createContext ( \\\" light \\\" ); function App () { const theme = use ( ThemeContext ); // async-safe return < div className = { theme } > ... </ div >; }\\n```\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## []() 3\\\\. Leverage Actions for Forms\\n\\nReact 19 Actions make forms **simpler and server-friendly** . **Best Practices:**\\n\\n* Use Actions for server-side mutations whenever possible\\n* Keep client logic minimal in forms\\n* Combine Actions with server components for clean architecture\\n\\n```\\nasync function postComment ( formData ) { \\\" use server \\\" ; await db . comments .\\ncreate ( formData ); } < form action = { postComment } > < input name = \\\"text\\\" /> < button type = \\\"submit\\\" > Post </ button > </ form >\\n```\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## []() 4\\\\. Use Server Components Wisely\\n\\nServer Components reduce bundle size and improve initial render speed. **Best Practices:**\\n\\n* Move **non-interactive components** (lists, tables, content) to the server\\n* Keep interactive components (buttons, forms) as client components\\n* Combine with Suspense for smooth loading states\\n\\n```\\n// Server Component export default async function ProductList () { const products = await db . products . getAll (); return products . map ( p => < p key = { p . id } > { p . name } </ p >); }\\n```\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## []() 5\\\\. Optimize Asset Loading\\n\\nReact 19 handles asset loading more efficiently.\\n**Best Practices:**\\n\\n* Remove unnecessary `<link>` preloads if React handles them automatically\\n* Monitor Web Vitals and Lighthouse scores after upgrading\\n* Lazy-load large components with `React.lazy` \\\\+ `Suspense`\\n\\n```\\nconst Chart = React . lazy (() => import ( \\\" ./Chart \\\" )); < Suspense fallback = { < p > Loading chart... </ p > } > < Chart /> </ Suspense >\\n```\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## []() 6\\\\. Use Concurrent Rendering Features Thoughtfully\\n\\nConcurrent rendering improves UX but requires careful usage. **Best Practices:**\\n\\n* Use `startTransition` for non-urgent state updates\\n* Use `Suspense` to suspend UI during data fetching\\n* Avoid blocking main UI updates with heavy computations\\n\\n```\\nimport { startTransition } from \\\" react \\\" ; startTransition (() => { setSearchResults ( filteredData ); });\\n```\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## []() 7\\\\. Keep State Local Whenever Possible\\n\\nLifting state too high triggers unnecessary re-renders.\\n**Best Practices:**\\n\\n* Store state in the nearest component that needs it\\n* Use context for truly shared state\\n* Consider custom hooks for reusable logic\\n\\n```\\nfunction useToggle ( initial = false ) { const [ state , setState ] = useState ( initial ); const toggle = () => setState ( prev => ! prev ); return [ state , toggle ]; }\\n```\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## []() 8\\\\. Testing and Debugging\\n\\nReact 19 introduces async-safe features that may break poorly tested apps. **Best Practices:**\\n\\n* Test server components with proper mocks\\n* Use React Profiler to identify re-renders\\n* Verify Suspense boundaries for smooth UX\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## []() Final Thoughts\\n\\nReact 19 is about **less boilerplate, better performance, and modern DX** .\\nBy following these best practices, you can:  \\nWrite cleaner code  \\nReduce bugs and unnecessary re-renders  \\nImprove performance for users  \\nFully leverage server components and new features\\n\\nReact 19 makes modern React development **faster and easier** , but only if you adopt **best practices** early. * * *\\n\\nWhat best practices are you using in React 19?

While this works, the code can quickly become cluttered and difficult to extend.\\nBy introducing **render props** , we can achieve cleaner, more flexible code that scales with the needs of your application. Let’s first look at how to build a table using normal props rendering and then refactor it using the render props pattern to demonstrate why it’s a better approach. # Step 1: Normal Props Rendering in `CommonTable`\\n\\nInitially, you might write your table component with conditions for rendering descriptions based on specific props.\\nHere’s how the `CommonTable` component might look using normal prop rendering:\\n\\n```\\nconst staticHeaders = [  \\n  { id: 'name', label: 'Name' },  \\n  { id: 'age', label: 'Age' },  \\n  { id: 'location', label: 'Location' },  \\n  { id: 'action', label: 'Action' },  \\n  { id: 'options', label: 'Options' },  \\n];  \\n  \\nconst CommonTable = ({ headers, data }) => {  \\n  return (  \\n    <table>  \\n      <thead>  \\n        <tr>  \\n          {headers.map((header) => (  \\n            <th key={header.id}>{header.label}</th>  \\n          ))}  \\n        </tr>  \\n      </thead>  \\n      <tbody>  \\n        {data.map((row, index) => (  \\n          <tr key={index}>  \\n            {headers.map((header) => (  \\n              <td key={header.id}>  \\n                {/* Conditional rendering inside the component */}  \\n                {header.id === 'action' ? (  \\n                  <button onClick={() => alert(`Action on ${row.name}`)}>Action</button>  \\n                ) : header.id === 'options' ?\\n(  \\n                  <select>  \\n                    {row.options.map((option, idx) => (  \\n                      <option key={idx} value={option}>  \\n                        {option}  \\n                      </option>  \\n                    ))}  \\n                  </select>  \\n                ) : (  \\n                  row[header.id]  \\n                )}  \\n              </td>  \\n            ))}  \\n          </tr>  \\n        ))}  \\n      </tbody>  \\n    </table>  \\n  );  \\n};\\n```\\n\\n## Explanation:\\n\\n* The component accepts `headers` and `data` as props. * Conditional rendering is used within the component to check the header’s `id` (e.g., `action` or `options` ) and render buttons or dropdowns accordingly. # Step 2: Introducing Render Props for Flexibility\\n\\nA better solution is to use **render props** , where we delegate rendering responsibility for each cell to a function provided via the header.\\nThis way, you can control how each cell is rendered without cluttering the `CommonTable` with conditional logic.\\nHere’s how to refactor the component using render props:\\n\\n```\\nconst staticHeaders = [  \\n  { id: 'name', label: 'Name', render: (row) => row.name },  \\n  { id: 'age', label: 'Age', render: (row) => row.age },  \\n  { id: 'location', label: 'Location', render: (row) => row.location },  \\n  { id: 'action', label: 'Action', render: (row) => <button onClick={() => alert(`Action on ${row.name}`)}>Action</button> },  \\n  { id: 'options', label: 'Options', render: (row) => (  \\n      <select>  \\n        {row.options.map((option, idx) => (  \\n          <option key={idx} value={option}>  \\n            {option}  \\n          </option>  \\n        ))}  \\n      </select>  \\n    )  \\n  },  \\n];  \\n  \\nconst CommonTable = ({ headers, data }) => {  \\n  return (  \\n    <table>  \\n      <thead>  \\n        <tr>  \\n          {headers.map((header) => (  \\n            <th key={header.id}>{header.label}</th>  \\n          ))}  \\n        </tr>  \\n      </thead>  \\n      <tbody>  \\n        {data.map((row, index) => (  \\n          <tr\\nkey={index}>  \\n            {headers.map((header) => (  \\n              <td key={header.id}>{header.render(row)}</td>  \\n            ))}  \\n          </tr>  \\n        ))}  \\n      </tbody>  \\n    </table>  \\n  );  \\n};\\n```\\n\\n## Why This is Better:\\n\\n* **Flexibility** : Instead of hard-coding the conditions in the table component, the rendering logic is defined in the `render` method of each header. You can now easily modify how each column is displayed. * **Scalability** : As your requirements grow (e.g., adding new types of columns like images or checkboxes), you can handle it by simply updating the `render` method in the headers without touching the core `CommonTable` component. * **Separation of Concerns** : The `CommonTable` no longer cares about how the cells are rendered. It simply delegates that responsibility to the `render` function, keeping the table logic clean and reusable.\\n# Step 3: Using the Render Props Pattern in Your App\\n\\nHere’s how you would use this `CommonTable` in a real-world scenario:\\n\\n```\\nconst data = [  \\n  { name: 'John', age: 25, location: 'New York', options: ['Edit', 'Delete'] },  \\n  { name: 'Jane', age: 30, location: 'London', options: ['Edit', 'Archive'] },  \\n];  \\n  \\nconst App = () => {  \\n  return (  \\n    <div>  \\n      <h1>Reusable Table with Render Props</h1>  \\n      <CommonTable headers={staticHeaders} data={data} />  \\n    </div>  \\n  );  \\n};\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, you can now easily modify how a column is rendered without touching the `CommonTable` . You simply update the `render` method in the `staticHeaders` array to change the behavior of that specific column. # Conclusion\\n\\nUsing normal props rendering with conditions inside the table component works for simple cases but can become cumbersome as the complexity of your application grows.\\nBy refactoring the table to use render props, you gain flexibility, scalability, and better separation of concerns. This pattern makes your table component much more powerful and adaptable to various rendering needs. Whether you’re handling buttons, dropdowns, or custom UI elements, the render props pattern allows you to keep your table logic clean and focused while providing full control over how individual cells are rendered. # Disclaimer\\n\\nThe pattern of using render props is not just limited to table components — it’s a widely used practice for building **reusable** components in React. Whether it’s a form field, a card component, or a modal, render props provide flexibility, making your components more adaptable and easier to maintain. Thank you for reading!

You sprinkle some `useState` , wrap everything in `useEffect` , and copy a few snippets from StackOverflow. Boom — it works. Until it doesn’t. 😅\\n\\nAs apps grow bigger and teams scale, the quick hacks turn into technical debt. That’s when advanced React patterns come into play — they help you write cleaner, scalable, and maintainable code that doesn’t drive your teammates (or future you) crazy. ## Get Vishal Solanki’s stories in your inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from this writer. Subscribe\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\nHere are 10 patterns that every mid-to-senior React engineer should keep in their toolkit. ## 1\\\\.\\nCompound Components Pattern\\n\\nInstead of stuffing 20 props into one giant component, you can let users compose UI elements naturally. ```\\n< Tabs >  \\n< Tabs.List >  \\n< Tabs.Trigger value = \\\"home\\\" > Home </ Tabs.Trigger >  \\n< Tabs.Trigger value = \\\"profile\\\" > Profile </ Tabs.Trigger >  \\n</ Tabs.List >  \\n< Tabs.Content value = \\\"home\\\" > 🏠 Home </ Tabs.Content >  \\n< Tabs.Content value = \\\"profile\\\" > 👤 Profile </ Tabs.Content >  \\n</ Tabs >\\n```\\n\\n✅ **Why it matters:** Gives you a flexible API while keeping state management internal. ## 2\\\\. Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components\\n\\nControlled components use React state, while uncontrolled components manage their own state. ```\\n// Controlled  \\n< input value = {value} onChange = {e  =>  setValue(e.target.value)} />\\n```\\n\\n```\\n// Uncontrolled  \\n<input defaultValue=\\\"Hello\\\" ref={inputRef} />\\n```\\n\\n👉 **Rule of thumb:** Controlled = predictable, Uncontrolled = simpler & faster. Many production apps mix both (aka semi-controlled). ## 3\\\\.\\nRender Props Pattern\\n\\nSometimes you want to abstract logic but let the consumer decide the UI. ```\\n< MouseTracker >  \\n  { ( { x, y } ) => < p > Mouse position: {x}, {y} </ p > }  \\n</ MouseTracker >\\n```\\n\\n✅ **Why it matters:** Share logic without forcing a specific UI. ## 4\\\\. Custom Hooks for Business Logic\\n\\nIf your component is bloated with 300 lines of logic, it’s time to extract a custom hook. ```\\nfunction  useAuth ()  {  \\nconst  [user, setUser] = useState( null );\\n```\\n\\n```\\n  const login = (creds) => {/* logic */};  \\n  const logout = () => {/* logic */};  return { user, login, logout };  \\n}\\n```\\n\\nKeeps components small, clean, and testable. ## 5\\\\. Context with Selectors\\n\\nNaïve context usage re-renders every consumer when the value changes. Instead, use selectors:\\n\\n```\\nconst  name =  useContextSelector ( UserContext ,  v  =>  v. name );\\n```\\n\\n✅ **Benefit:** Avoids unnecessary renders → smoother performance in large apps. ## 6\\\\.\\nError Boundaries\\n\\nReact hooks can’t catch render errors — but error boundaries can. ```\\nclass ErrorBoundary extends React .Component {  \\n  state = { hasError:  false  };\\n```\\n\\n```\\n  static getDerivedStateFromError() { return { hasError: true }; }  render() {  \\n    if (this.state.hasError) return <h2>Something went wrong 😢</h2>;  \\n    return this.props.children;  \\n  }  \\n}\\n```\\n\\nAlways wrap production apps with error boundaries (especially around API-heavy sections). ## 7\\\\. Suspense for Data Fetching\\n\\nWith React 18 and Next.js 13+, Suspense + `use` hook make loading states elegant. ```\\nconst  resource =  fetchUser ( \\\"/api/user\\\" );\\n```\\n\\n```\\nfunction Profile() {  \\n  const user = resource.read();  \\n  return <h1>{user.name}</h1>;  \\n}\\n```\\n\\n🚀 **Future-proof your apps by learning Suspense. **\\n\\n## 8\\\\. Memoization & Stabilizing Functions\\n\\nStop random re-renders by memoizing expensive computations and handlers.\\n```\\nconst  result = useMemo(() => heavyCalc( data ), [ data ]);  \\nconst  handleClick = useCallback(() => doSomething( val ), [ val ]);\\n```\\n\\n✅ **Performance boost** (just don’t overdo it). ## 9\\\\. Portals\\n\\nEver tried rendering a modal inside a deeply nested component and fought with CSS? Use Portals. ```\\nReactDOM . createPortal ( < Modal  /> ,  document . getElementById ( \\\"modal-root\\\" ));\\n```\\n\\nClean, predictable, and no CSS hacks. ## 10\\\\. State Machines (Bonus 🔥)\\n\\nFor complex UI flows, if-else spaghetti doesn’t scale. State machines (e.g., XState) bring predictability. ```\\nconst [ state ,  send ] = useMachine(toggleMachine);\\n```\\n\\n```\\nif (state.matches(\\\"on\\\")) return <button onClick={() => send(\\\"TOGGLE\\\")}>ON</button>;\\n```\\n\\n✅ **Perfect for forms, multi-step flows, and apps where “state explosion” is common. **\\n\\n## Final Thoughts\\n\\nAdvanced React isn’t about memorizing every pattern — it’s about knowing when and why to use them. * Repeated logic? → **Custom Hooks**\\n* Too many props?\\n→ **Compound Components**\\n* Painful re-renders? → **Context Selectors + Memoization**\\n* Complex flows? → **State Machines**\\n* Errors lurking? → **Error Boundaries**\\n\\nYou’re not just writing components anymore.

Some common examples of such interactions are switching between tabs, loading paginated data, and filtering or sorting dynamic content.\\nReact makes these interactions easier with its built-in and third-party state management solutions such as the [`useState` Hook](https://blog.logrocket.com/guide-usestate-react/) , [the Context API](https://blog.logrocket.com/react-context-api-deep-dive-examples/) , [Redux](https://blog.logrocket.com/understanding-redux-tutorial-examples/) , and more. However, some cases demand that states persist in support of the app’s overall UX. In such scenarios, using client-side storage or databases doesn’t make much sense, as this persistence has more to do with the app’s universal usability than personalization. This tutorial will explore handling such state changes with URL and search parameters. By the end, you’ll understand the importance of URL-based state management in React with its SEO, performance, and accessibility considerations. _N.B.,_ As a prerequisite, you should have a general idea of working with React, React Hooks, and TypeScript.\\nThe code examples in this guide use Tailwind CSS for UI styling, but we won’t focus on it too much. You can find the source code in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/c99rahul/url-based-react-state/) . ### 🚀 Sign up for The Replay newsletter\\n\\n[**The Replay**](https://blog.logrocket.com/the-replay-archive/) is a weekly newsletter for dev and engineering leaders. Delivered once a week, it's your curated guide to the most important conversations around frontend dev, emerging AI tools, and the state of modern software. ## What is URL-based state management? When an app’s views depend on the URL for state changes, it is said to be managing states via URL. These changes in views range from small, interactive updates to huge ones that decide the core nature of a page.\\n ... \\nSince the URL here contains all the triggers controlling the crucial information on the page, you can save or bookmark it and revisit it to access the expected data, which is a big plus from a UX perspective. On the other hand, React apps do the exact opposite of the example above. By default, they can’t control the state from the URL unless we tell them to. ## Advantages of URL-based state management\\n\\nManaging states with the URL should establish a bidirectional data flow between the application states and the URL. This is important to keep the states synchronized and fresh and avoid using stale data.\\nHere’s what URL-based state management setup using React (with React Router DOM library) brings to the table:\\n\\n* **Shareable views** : Users can copy, share, and save URLs representing specific application states and catch up later from where they left off\\n* **Browser history integration** : Seamless browser navigation using backward/forward arrow buttons\\n* **Server-side rendering compatibility** : The initial state can be sent from the server through the URL and parsed on the client with router utilities; the rest of the app can operate on the client to manage the URL-based state handling\\n\\nManaging states with URLs is largely a client-side concern, which makes client-side rendering the key focus of this article. It’s worth noting that URL-based state management is not a replacement for [traditional state management](https://blog.logrocket.com/guide-choosing-right-react-state-management-solution/) .\\nThese two work together to enable the utilization of URLs to persist views, making the overall app more accessible and user-friendly. ## Step-by-step URL-based state management with React\\n\\nBuilding a store-like utility is perfect for demonstrating the implementation of state management using URLs in React, as it poses some complex challenges, such as paging and filtering data. * * *\\n\\n[## Over 200k developers use LogRocket to create better digital experiences Learn more →](https://lp.logrocket.com/blg/learn-more)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nLet’s create an app that uses a mock JSON API to fetch dummy product data in a paged fashion, as we might see on ecommerce apps. We’ll add more features later, such as filtering products on a categorical, price, and rating basis. Setting up a React app with TypeScript is fairly simple with pnpm and Vite:\\n\\n```\\npnpm create vite@latest url-based-react-state -- --template react\\n```\\n\\nPick TypeScript as the core language, and you are good to go.\\nAfter cd-ing into the project directory and installing the required dependencies, you may add Tailwind CSS to the app or skip it if you are considering a different UI solution. ### Project folder structure\\n\\nCreating dedicated directories to organize things is a best practice at the start of any project. I’m considering separating the API logic from the components and will provide them with the data they need with some custom React Hooks. Following the same approach with the types, utilities, and configuration data, the final project folder looks something like the following:\\n\\n### Setting up the router\\n\\nTo work with routes and the browser URL, we should install the [React Router DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) package, a library built on top of the core React router for handling routing smoothly.\\nAt this point, we should also install the [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) to avoid the repeating usage of state boilerplate in our hooks and handle errors and data caching more efficiently:\\n\\n```\\npnpm add react-router-dom @tanstack/react-query\\n```\\n\\nFor the TanStack Query and routing to work properly, our `App` component should be wrapped within `QueryClientProvider` , which should be placed inside the `BrowserRouter` component as shown below:\\n\\n```\\n// src/Main.tsx\\nimport { BrowserRouter } from \\\"react-router-dom\\\";\\nimport { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from \\\"@tanstack/react-query\\\";\\n/* Other imports... */\\n\\nconst queryClient = new QueryClient();\\n\\ncreateRoot(document.getElementById(\\\"root\\\")!\\n).render(\\n  <StrictMode>\\n    <BrowserRouter>\\n      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>\\n        <App />\\n      </QueryClientProvider>\\n    </BrowserRouter>\\n  </StrictMode>\\n);\\n```\\n\\nWe can now add routes to the `App` component according to our requirements and hand them the components they are supposed to show:\\n\\n```\\n// src/App.tsx\\n\\nexport default function App() {\\n  return (\\n    <>\\n      <Navbar />\\n      <Routes>\\n        <Route path=\\\"/\\\" element={ /* HomePage component */ } />\\n        <Route path=\\\"*\\\" element={ /* NotFoundPage component */ } />\\n      </Routes>\\n    </>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Defining types\\n\\nAs discussed, we are using the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/) to populate views in our app. If you have a backend API of your own, you may use it instead with the required changes in types and URL endpoints.\\n ... \\ncurrentPage > 1,\\n    goToNext: () => currentPage < totalPages && goToPage(currentPage + 1),\\n    goToPrevious: () => currentPage > 1 && goToPage(currentPage - 1),\\n  };\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Defining components\\n\\nWith the API client and `useProducts` Hook to do all the heavy lifting, the structure and functioning of components will be pretty straightforward. Let’s create three components in the `components/product` directory that handle the rendering of individual cards, a grid of such cards, and the pagination of the card grid. The `ProductCard` component takes the product data as a prop and uses its properties, such as title, name, price, thumbnail, etc., to give the card some identity.\\n ... \\n(\\n          <div>Loading...</div>\\n        ) : (\\n          <>\\n            <ProductGrid products={products} />\\n            <Pagination\\n              currentPage={currentPage}\\n              totalPages={totalPages}\\n              onNext={goToNext}\\n              onPrevious={goToPrevious}\\n              hasNext={hasNext}\\n              hasPrevious={hasPrevious}\\n              isLoading={loading}\\n            />\\n          </>\\n        )}\\n      </section>\\n    </main>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nRunning the app and visiting the `/products` path should show you something like the following, where loading and filtering are managed through the URL:\\n\\nI’ve also implemented the loading of individual products when clicking corresponding card titles in the grid. You should also consider implementing it as an assignment.\\n## Performance optimization in React apps using URL parameters\\n\\nYou typically don’t need `useCallback` or `useMemo` Hooks with TanStack Query, which is highly optimized and handles memoization pretty well by default. If you choose not to use it, always consider using `useCallback` in your hooks to cache a function between re-renders and avoid unnecessary API calls. Also, implement `useMemo` if you want to cache a response for some time. ### Memory optimization\\n\\nThe examples we saw in this tutorial maintain browser history, which can be expensive memory-wise with frequent URL updates.\\nConsider using the `useNavigate` Hook and replacing history entries instead of pushing them to the browser history:\\n\\n```\\nimport { useNavigate } from \\\"react-router-dom\\\";\\nconst navigate = useNavigate();\\n// ...\\n\\nnavigate(`?${newParams.toString()}`, { replace: true });\\n```\\n\\n### State synchronization between URL states and API calls\\n\\nIf you expand the app further and implement a product search feature, an API call is made whenever something is typed in the search box.\\n ... \\n## Accessibility considerations in React apps with URL state management\\n\\nThe React Router DOM library solves browser accessibility by allowing users to use backward/forward browser navigation, which is absent in React apps by default. General accessibility is pretty much the same as what we usually do with our React apps; we use ARIA to make the app accessible for screen readers and follow general accessibility practices. For URL-based state management, always focus on providing the most commonly used information through the URL. Avoid exposing information you don’t want to provide publicly through the API, which mostly depends on how your backend and its API are built. Keep an eye on API security and its correct implementation. ## SEO considerations for URL-based state management in React\\n\\nURLs with different parameters are treated as separate pages by search engines, which is great from an SEO point of view.\\n ... \\n[](https://blog.logrocket.com/author/danielschwarz/) [Daniel Schwarz](https://blog.logrocket.com/author/danielschwarz/)\\n\\nNov 26, 2025 ⋅ 7 min read\\n\\n[View all posts](https://blog.logrocket.com/)\\n\\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/advanced-react-state-management-using-url-parameters)\\n\\nWould you be interested in joining LogRocket's developer community?

For example, you won’t write commands like “disable the button”, “enable the button”, “show the success message”, etc.\\nInstead, you will describe the UI you want to see for the different visual states of your component (“initial state”, “typing state”, “success state”), and then trigger the state changes in response to user input. This is similar to how designers think about UI. Here is a quiz form built using React. Note how it uses the `status` state variable to determine whether to enable or disable the submit button, and whether to show the success message instead.

To do it, remove state from both of them, move it to their closest common parent, and then pass it down to them via props. This is known as “lifting state up”, and it’s one of the most common things you will do writing React code. In this example, only one panel should be active at a time. To achieve this, instead of keeping the active state inside each individual panel, the parent component holds the state and specifies the props for its children.\\nApp.js\\n\\nApp.js\\n\\nReload Clear [Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app \\\"Open in CodeSandbox\\\")\\n\\n```\\nimport { useState } from 'react' ; \\n\\n export default function Accordion ( ) { \\n  const [ activeIndex , setActiveIndex ] = useState ( 0 ) ; \\n  return ( \\n    < > \\n      < h2 > Almaty, Kazakhstan </ h2 > \\n      < Panel \\n        title = \\\"About\\\" \\n        isActive = { activeIndex === 0 } \\n        onShow = { ( ) => setActiveIndex ( 0 ) } \\n      > \\n        With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest city.

In most cases, React’s automatic behavior works well enough. By default, React preserves the parts of the tree that “match up” with the previously rendered component tree. However, sometimes this is not what you want. In this chat app, typing a message and then switching the recipient does not reset the input.\\n ... \\ndifferent `key` , like `<Chat key={email} />` . This tells React that if the recipient is different, it should be considered a _different_ `Chat` component that needs to be re-created from scratch with the new data (and UI like inputs). Now switching between the recipients resets the input field—even though you render the same component.

So basically, it is a combination of TanStack functionality and Material UI v6 design. ### What is the difference between TanStack Table and Material UI Table? TanStack Table is a headless table library for building tables and data grids for any JavaScript framework, while Material UI Table is a component within the MUI React component library. ### How do I create a table in React? You can use `@tanstack/react-table` for a powerful, customizable table or the native HTML `<table>` element for simple use cases. For styled tables, you can also look at libraries like Material React Table, Material UI Table, or [React Bootstrap](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-bootstrap-react-tutorial-examples/) . ## Conclusion\\n\\nIn this article, we learned how to build a table UI using React and TanStack Table.\\n ... \\n(Optional) Install plugins for deeper integrations with your stack:\\n   \\n    + Redux middleware\\n    + NgRx middleware\\n    + Vuex plugin\\n\\n[Get started now](https://lp.logrocket.com/blg/react-signup-general)\\n\\n* [\\\\](https://blog.logrocket.com/tag/react/)\\n\\n#### Recent posts:\\n\\n[#### How to use ChatGPT Atlas for frontend debugging, testing, and more](https://blog.logrocket.com/chatgpt-atlas-for-frontend/)\\n\\nLearn how ChatGPT’s new browser Atlas fits into a frontend developer’s toolkit, including the debugging and testing process.

For a long time, most web design was built with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. [React brought a much-needed sigh of relief](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/what-is-react/) for developers with its ease of use. The reusable components, great developer tools, and extensive ecosystem are some of the most loved features of React.\\nInstead of the traditional approach of directly manipulating the DOM, React introduced a useful level of abstraction in the form of the virtual DOM concept. The library is being actively developed and maintained by React developers at the tech giant Facebook. This provides it with a much-needed edge over other frameworks and libraries. Countless contributors in the JavaScript community also regularly contribute to refining and improving React. All these factors allow React to maintain its popularity among developers even though newer frameworks are constantly emerging and competing for recognition amongst frontend developers. Design patterns not only speed up the development process but also make the code easier to read and As React continues to dominate the front-end development landscape, building scalable, maintainable, and reusable components is essential for any modern application.\\n ... \\nThis results in fewer errors and saves time during debugging and figuring out problems that could have been easily avoided if an appropriate design pattern had been implemented. Like every other good programming library, React makes extensive use of [design patterns](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/top-react-component-libraries/) to provide developers a powerful tool. By properly following the React philosophy, developers can produce some extraordinary applications. Now that you have an understanding of design patterns. Let us move on to some of the most widely used design patterns available in React.js. ## Why Do You Need React Design Patterns? * **Efficiency** : Patterns allow you to create reusable components, reducing duplication and improving development speed. * **Maintainability** : Structured patterns make code easier to understand and maintain, especially in large applications.\\n* **Scalability** : Well-structured components make it easier to scale your application as it grows in complexity. ## 1\\\\. Container and Presentational Pattern\\n\\nThe Container and Presentational pattern is one of the most popular in React applications. It separates the logic (state management) from the presentation (UI rendering), making components more reusable and easier to maintain. **Example:**\\n\\n```\\n// Container Component\\nclass UserContainer extends React.Component {\\n  state = { user: null };\\n\\n  componentDidMount() {\\n    fetchUser().then(user => this.setState({ user }));\\n  }\\n\\n  render() {\\n    return <UserProfile user={this.state.user} />;\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n// Presentational Component\\nconst UserProfile = ({ user }) => (\\n  <div>\\n    {user ? <p>{user.name}</p> : <p>Loading...</p>}\\n  </div>\\n);\\n```\\n\\n**Use Case** : The container manages data-fetching logic, while the presentational component only focuses on displaying the UI. This separation enhances maintainability and simplifies testing. ## 2\\\\.\\nCompound Components\\n\\nCompound components are a flexible pattern where multiple components work together as a single unit, allowing users to customize how child components are rendered within a parent component. **Example:**\\n\\n```\\nconst Dropdown = ({ children }) => {\\n  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);\\n\\n  return (\\n    <div>\\n      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen)}>Toggle</button>\\n      {isOpen && <div>{children}</div>}\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n};\\n\\nconst DropdownItem"
  },
  {
    "type": "text",
    "text": "\n\n[OUTPUT TRUNCATED - exceeded 25000 token limit]\n\nThe tool output was truncated. If this MCP server provides pagination or filtering tools, use them to retrieve specific portions of the data. If pagination is not available, inform the user that you are working with truncated output and results may be incomplete."
